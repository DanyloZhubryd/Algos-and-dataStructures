<h1>Lab 1</h1></br>
The task is to implement a <h3>Quick Sort</h3> sorting algorithm. The input data is a one-dimensional array of numbers, which is written through a comma and can be run as follows:</br>
python merge_sort.py asc 1,2,56,45, -9,78,11</br>
java MergeSort.java desc 1,2,56,45, -9,78,11</br>
asc - ascending</br>
desc - descending</br>
That is, your code must be able to sort ascending. and descending</br>
The result should display:</br>
- the name of the algorithm</br>
- work time</br>
- the number of comparison operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm</br>
- the number of exchange operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm</br>
- Sorting results</br>
